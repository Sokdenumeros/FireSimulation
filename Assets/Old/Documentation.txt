To run a new simulation:

1 - Preprocess
	1.1 	Run python3 ./simulationinfo.py and drag and drop the directory of the simulation ie. "Entrepinos HF LC 7.6.5"
		This will display what is inside each 3D smoke object so you can make sure which are the ones that you want.
	1.2	Go to the last lines of fdstoraw3.py and make sure that you are extracting the data you want ie. make sure that extract_f32_data(sim.smoke_3d[0],'smokePinos') is the correct smoke3D and correct name
	1.3	Run python3 ./fdstoraw3.py and drag and drop the directory of the simulation
			For very big simulations this can give errors if you dont have enough memory. You can increase the virtual memory if this happens to you.
			If you need to increase the virtual memory, note that the execution may take a very long time to complete.
	1.4	Run python3 ./rawtoparticles.py and drag and drop first the smoke directory that has just been created and then the heat directory.
			Before running it you can choose to adjust some parameters of the script:
				nparticles - max number of particles per time instant
				opacityThreshold - how much soot density is needed to count as a particle
				particleDir - name of the directory where the particles will be stored
				particleDataDir - name of the directory where the particles data (color) will be stored
2 - Unity
	2.1	You need a Unity scene with:
			- A Disable Frustrum Culling script (set your main camera to Cam Object)
			- Two Byte Loader Scripts
				Timestep should be set at the time separation between data files
				Pre should be set to the string characters of the file path previous to the timestamp (make sure that the path is correct)
				Post should be set to the string characters of the file path posterior to the timestamp (should just be .raw)
			- A simulation Manager script with
				Particle Updater = DataUnpacking.compute
				Smokemat = CustomSmokeSpot
				Quadmesh = Quad
				Pman = one of the two byte loader scripts, the one loading particles
				Sman = the other byte loader, the one loading particle data
				Gridx,y,z Files = path to the gridx,y,z files in smoke or heat directories
				nparticles = max number of particles
				particle size = radius of the particles
				Cam = main camera
				order (not relevant for now)
