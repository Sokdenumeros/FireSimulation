Z is vertical in smokeview, Y is vertical in unity, so the python scripts need to change the order of the second and third components of vectors and positions

2 IDEAS FOR SMOKE:
TRANSPARENT SHADER
2 pass RevSub and Add shader

THINGS TO DO-------------------------------------------------------------
Rotate particles so they look at the camera
Correct memory leaks
VR plugin
Fix frustrum culling
Adjust number of particles to avoid having extra ones at 0,0,0
Change the dot texture by a more complicated cloud
From buffer to texture 3D = smoother, hardware accelerated samples

RenderParams rp = new RenderParams(material);
rp.worldBounds = new Bounds(Vector3.zero, 10000*Vector3.one); // use tighter bounds for better FOV culling

THINGS TO TWEAK-----------------------------------------------------------
size of the particles
transfer function
colors to blend between
opacity
density/number of particles
