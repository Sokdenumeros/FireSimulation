Dynamic batching (use renderer.sharedmaterial)

Z is vertical in smokeview, Y is vertical in unity, so the python scripts need to change the order of the second and third components of vectors and positions

Things to do:
change the float struct to Template struct
How do I rotate the particles so they are always looking at the camera? Maybe with the negative forward vector of the camera is enough?


with paint with material of instanced object: some timestamps are invisible
with paint with fsmat: some timestamps are invisible

with instances:
with material of the instanced object: Looks good
with fsmat: looks bad and one timestamp is invisible

optimal transport
