Z is vertical in smokeview, Y is vertical in unity, so the python scripts need to change the order of the second and third components of vectors and positions

2 IDEAS FOR SMOKE:
TRANSPARENT SHADER
2 pass RevSub and Add shader

THINGS TO DO-------------------------------------------------------------
Need to paint the particles in order because fire looks diferent depending on the order(sort of)
Rotate particles so they look at the camera -- NOT WORKING
Adjust number of particles to avoid having extra ones at 0,0,0
Change fov culling so it works even on the scene camera
Fix frustrum culling
Change the dot texture by a more complicated cloud
From buffer to texture 3D = smoother, hardware accelerated samples
Change drawing order based on camera position
Look up all the shader tags
Remove lines that were only used for the instanced drawing
Profile performance
Optimizations: reduce number of data copies and number of buffer assignments
Python can't load entrepinos because there's 120Gb of data
	adjust unity script to work without velocities
	improve python script
Direct storage?
numpy agrwhere

RenderParams rp = new RenderParams(material);
rp.worldBounds = new Bounds(Vector3.zero, 10000*Vector3.one); // use tighter bounds for better FOV culling

THINGS TO REDUCE NUMBER OF FRAGMENTS--------------------------------------
double opacity and half particles
particle lookat = camera lookat + backface culling

THINGS TO IMPROVE DATA SENDING:

https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/Texture3D.html
https://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/5hkudv/comment/db1bx9i/

THINGS TO TWEAK-----------------------------------------------------------
size of the particles
transfer function
colors to blend between
opacity
density/number of particles

IDEAS THAT I WILL PROBABLY NEVER NEED AGAIN:-------------------------------
Dynamic batching (use renderer.sharedmaterial)
Unity VFX
Raycasting 
Gaussian Splatting

optimal transport interpolation

THINGS TO FIX ABOUT THE FDSREADER------------------------------------------
global_max is not needed since it is exactly the same as coord_max
Why does it take out the first index of the array but saves the last an adds the last back again when it wasn't taken out in the first place?
why does it only calculate n_repeat if masked? it should repeat the array as long as it has different step size regardless of the mask
