Z is vertical in smokeview, Y is vertical in unity, so the python scripts need to change the order of the second and third components of vectors and positions

2 IDEAS FOR SMOKE:
TRANSPARENT SHADER
2 pass RevSub and Add shader

THINGS TO DO-------------------------------------------------------------
Rotate particles so they look at the camera
Correct memory leaks
Adjust number of particles to avoid having extra ones at 0,0,0
Change fov culling so it works even on the scene camera
Fix frustrum culling
VR plugin
Change the dot texture by a more complicated cloud
From buffer to texture 3D = smoother, hardware accelerated samples
Change drawing order based on camera position
Look up all the shader tags
Remove lines that were only used for the instanced drawing
Profile performance
Optimizations: reduce number of data copies and number of buffer assignments
Python can't load entrepinos because there's 120Gb of data

RenderParams rp = new RenderParams(material);
rp.worldBounds = new Bounds(Vector3.zero, 10000*Vector3.one); // use tighter bounds for better FOV culling

THINGS TO TWEAK-----------------------------------------------------------
size of the particles
transfer function
colors to blend between
opacity
density/number of particles
